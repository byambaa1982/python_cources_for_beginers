## After completing the exercises provided, students will have gained the following skills and understanding:

## 1. Lists:

- How to create and manipulate lists, such as adding, removing, and modifying elements.
- How to perform calculations on list elements, like finding the sum, average, maximum, and minimum values.
- How to access and find the indices of list elements.
- How to filter lists using list comprehensions and conditional statements.
- Understanding the concept of mutable data structures in Python.

## 2. Tuples:

- How to create and access elements in tuples.
- Understanding the differences between lists and tuples, specifically the immutability of tuples.
- How to handle the immutability of tuples by converting them to lists, making changes, and converting them back to tuples.
- Familiarity with common tuple operations, such as finding the length of a tuple.

## 3. Control structures and conditional statements:


- How to use for loops to iterate over lists and tuples.
- How to use conditional statements (if, else) inside for loops to filter or modify elements based on certain conditions.
By completing these exercises, students will have a solid foundation in working with lists and tuples in Python, as well as a better understanding of how to use control structures and conditional statements. These skills are essential for many programming tasks, including data processing, analysis, and manipulation.

## 4. Dictionaries:

- How to create dictionaries using curly braces and the dict() constructor.
- How to access values in a dictionary using their corresponding keys.
- How to modify values in a dictionary by updating their keys with new values.
- How to add new key-value pairs to a dictionary.
- How to check if a key exists in a dictionary using the in keyword.
