# Python Functions and Basic Control Structures

## Outline:

## 1. Introduction to Python functions

- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return statements
- Example: Basic function to add two numbers

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result
```

## 2. Working with strings in functions

- Example: Function to concatenate two strings
- Example: Function to reverse a string

3. Homework assignment: Understanding Functions in Python

- Multiply two numbers
- Count vowels in a string
- Check if a string is a palindrome
- Convert temperature between Celsius and Fahrenheit
- Calculate the area of a rectangle

```python
def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    # Your code here

# Test your function
print(multiply_numbers(3, 4))  # Output: 12
```
## 4. Solutions and explanations for the homework assignment

## 5. Introduction to control structures in Python

- For loops
- If-else statements
- Example: Function to count even and odd numbers in a list

```python
def count_even_odd_numbers(numbers):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0

    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1

    return even_count, odd_count

```

## After completing this class, students will know:

- How to define and call Python functions
- How to use parameters and return statements in functions
- How to work with strings in functions, including concatenating and reversing strings
- How to create and use basic control structures in Python, such as for loops and if-else statements
- How to apply their knowledge of functions and control structures to solve various programming problems, as demonstrated in the homework assignment and examples
