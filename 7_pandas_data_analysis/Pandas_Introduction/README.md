# Mini Project: Word Frequency Counter

## Objective:

Create a Python script that reads a text file and outputs the frequency of each word in the text. This project will help students practice working with strings, loops, dictionaries, and file input/output.

## Instructions:

1. Read a text file as input.
2. Clean and tokenize the text: convert the text to lowercase, remove punctuation, and split the text into words.
3. Count the frequency of each word using a dictionary.
4. Sort the words by their frequency and display the top N most frequent words.
